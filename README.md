# Cprint-flask
# Inspiration
Only way we can collectively reduce carbon footprint is if we take individualistic responsibilities. Our project aims to facilitate this by providing everyone an easy to use and intuitive application that helps them stay environment friendly. As we already know, global warming is a very serious issue .

# What it does
We wanted to create a platform where we can calculate the carbon footprint of each individual and compare it with the average carbon footprint of the crowd.

# How we built it
We have used SQLite database, Flask, Python and ARIMA model for projections.

# Challenges we ran into
Time was less to execute all our objectives
Lack of real life data for projections
Lack of latest per capita average data of carbon footprint for each resource
Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have taken one step closer to help society in reducing their carbon footprint.

# What we learned
Web development, time management, environmental awareness

# What's next for CPrint
More Analysis based on real data
More intuitive graphs
Suggestions to reduce carbon footprint
Added feature for user friendly experience by allowing them to upload an image of bills and with
